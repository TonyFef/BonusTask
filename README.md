# Marvel

Pet-project consisting of HTML-layout, CSS-styles && native JavaScript.

I had a .json list of characters only. Main task was to create my own web-site to render all the cards and made all design, styles and UI by my own.
Also, I implemented the function of filtering and search.
It my first project with own both idea and realization.

Unfortinately, that time I didn't know about webpack and other modern features.
